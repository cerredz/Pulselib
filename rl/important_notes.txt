Below are a set of important questions to think about when solving any reinforcement learning problem:


- define of return:
    - is task episodix or continuing, discounted, undiscounted

- action values vs state values vs afterstate values:
    - what is it that you will be predicting/estimating

- action selection/exploration:
    - how are you going to mantain exploration vs exploitation tradeoffs

- real vs simulated:
    - should updates to policy be based on real or simulated experience

- location of updates:
    - what should actually be updated in the rl task
    - should state values be updated, action-values be updated, state-action pairs, etc
    - should you update information about your model

- memory:
    - how long should information about the updates be retained for
